excerpt: 'Image processing holds immense potential for societal benefit, yet its full potential is often accessible only to tech-savvy experts. Bridging this knowledge gap and providing accessible tools for users of all backgrounds remains an unexplored frontier. This paper introduces "ImageLab," a novel tool designed to democratize image processing, catering to both novices and experts by prioritizing interactive learning over theoretical complexity. ImageLab not only serves as a valuable educational resource but also offers a practical testing environment for seasoned practitioners. Through a comprehensive evaluation of ImageLab features. we demonstrate its effectiveness through a user study done for a focused group of school children and university students which enables us to get positive feedback on the tool. Our work represents a significant stride toward enhancing image processing education and practice, making it more inclusive and approachable for all.'
