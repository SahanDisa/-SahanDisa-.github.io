The early detection of potential failures in industrial machinery components is paramount for ensuring the reliability and safety of operations, thereby preserving Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM). This research addresses this imperative by introducing an innovative approach to Real-Time Acoustic Anomaly Detection. Our method combines semi-supervised temporal convolution with representation learning and a hybrid model strategy with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to handle various intricate anomaly patterns found in acoustic data effectively. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to established research in the field, underscoring the effectiveness of this approach. Not only do we present quantitative evidence of its superiority, but we also employ visual representations, such as t-SNE plots, to further substantiate the modelâ€™s efficacy.
